# Legacy Code Reference

⚠️ **REFERENCE ONLY - DO NOT MAINTAIN OR UPDATE** ⚠️

This directory contains the **legacy Drupal + React system** that is being replaced.

## Purpose

This code is here **only for reference** during the migration planning and development process. It should:
- ✅ Be used to understand existing functionality and requirements
- ✅ Inform architecture decisions for the new system
- ❌ **NOT** be modified, updated, or maintained
- ❌ **NOT** be treated as active code

## Migration Context

**Old System**: Drupal backend + React frontend  
**New System**: Contentful-driven backend + Next.js frontend (decoupled architecture)

The new system is being built from scratch with a decoupled architecture that will allow the backend to be changed off Contentful in the future if needed.

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent working on this project:
- This legacy code is **reference material only**
- Do not attempt to fix bugs or update this code
- Use it to understand requirements and inform the new implementation
- All active development should happen in the new codebase structure (created by Spec Kitty)
