# Learning Documentation

This directory contains learning/teaching documents for new technologies I'm exploring in this project.

## Documents

- **[spec-kitty.md](spec-kitty.md)** - Learning Spec Kitty workflow tool
- **[contentful.md](contentful.md)** - Learning Contentful CMS
- **[nextjs.md](nextjs.md)** - Learning Next.js framework

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
- **Learning journal**: Record what I learn as I go
- **Teaching notes**: Document steps for future reference or sharing
- **Progress tracking**: See how understanding evolves

## How to Use

Update each document as you learn:
- Add new concepts under "What I learned"
- Document setup steps as you do them
- Record gotchas and tips
- Note questions that come up
- Link to useful resources

These are living documents - update them throughout the project!
