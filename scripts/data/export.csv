"Prioritize simplicity","Prioritize simplicity. Simplicity doesn’t just happen, it has to be earned, and sometimes fought for. The natural path when developing computer systems leads to ever-increasing complexity. Achieving simplicity requires effort, focus, dedication, and discipline.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-01-sandwich.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Content owners over coders","Prioritize content owners over coders. The chief editor, not the chief programmer, should be the most powerful user, with the authority to turn on and off every extension (modules/themes/etc) on the site.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/site-owner.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Have a site builder","You should have a site builder role that is distinct from the module developers and themers on your project.  The site builder is the person in charge of the site, not the coders!  A typical professional site has several content creators, several module developers, a themer, and several project managers of various types.  Avoid the temptation to mix the roles.  Installing, updating, and configuring modules and themes is easy to do if they're properly designed and documented, but they rarely are.  Make sure they are, by separating responsibilities – don't let the module and theme developers install and turn on their own modules and themes, make them turn them over to the site builder, who has the time and incentive to keep track of (and document) how things fit together -- and who can extract the necessary information out of the coders, if necessary.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/sitebuilder.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Turn off the custom theme","Turn off the theme!  (On a development copy of your site, of course, not the live one.) When switched to an included theme, or a common contrib theme like Boostrap, everything (or at least, almost everything) on your site should function.  If it doesn't, it means you've built functionality into your theme, making it brittle and hard to maintain.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day4-programmer-looking-horrified-computer-on-fire.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Avoid building custom modules","Happy Friday --let's talk about custom modules! The ability to create custom modules is one the most powerful features of Drupal. Most of Drupal's functionality is supplied by modules just like the ones you can make yourself. There's literally nothing that can be done in Drupal that can't be done with a custom modules. So you might be surprised to learn that my advice is:
Don't do it!
Or at least, try to see if it's possible to get the results you seek without building a custom module. While it's often relatively easy for a programmer to achieve a desired effect with custom programming (especially if they've been recently working with some of the relevant systems) it's much harder to maintain custom code than it is to upgrade Drupal core and major contributed modules. Carefully consider whether there's a way to get what you need done. (If you do conclude that you should create a custom module, I'll have suggestions later on about how to minimize your pain.)",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day5-toddler-stop.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Module names and descriptions","Your custom modules should have ridiculously clear and complete names and descriptions.  
Custom modules should have a name and description that is so clear and complete that a child could explain what it does and why it's needed. This is one area where you should not follow the example of core or contrib modules! A custom module doesn't ""belong"" to the programmer(s) who wrote it, it belongs to the site owner. There should be no secrets.  
The name should reflect what the module DOES, not what it is or how it's made. And the description should be long and very complete. It should include the date the module was created, what it does, what components and facilities depends on, what depends on it, and the name and email address of the programmer(s) who made it (or who took over from them when they moved on.)  Also include a detailed README in the code base, with full information about what the module is for, how it works, who wrote it, and where it fits in with the rest of the site. This is the kind of information that is probably in your issue tracker (like Jira) but put it here too! Your issue tracker may very well be gone by the time you need this info, and it costs you nothing to duplicate it here.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day6-monk-documenting-code.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Off-line site copies","Everybody working on a site should have a working off-line copy of the site.

"Use Scrum","Use Scrum! 
The Scrum methodology works quite naturally with Drupal development, if you use it right. Every group modifies it; I've yet to see a single company that actually uses Scrum as it's defined in the Scrum Guide, though some come close. However, it's such an inspiring and well-written document (and so short!) that everybody should read it upon joining the team:
-end developer, a writer, deployment/dev ops, and maybe others. There can be a dedicated scrum master, or the site builder (not one of the coders!) can fill that role.
- The Scrum guide suggests one month sprints, but that's far too long for web development. Either two weeks (the most common) or even one week sprints.
- Almost everybody does the daily scrum wrong. It's not a daily status report. It's not for the project manager. It's a chance for the dev team to sync up with each other. The scrum master and product owner don't even have to be there. But the rest of the team should listen attentively and be involved. At the end of the daily scrum, every team member should be able to say what every other team member did yesterday and what they're planning to do today -- because they should be ready to help them, if they can.
- One more thing about the daily scrum: The three ""daily questions"" that are traditionally answered are ""what did you do yesterday, what are you doing today, and is anything blocking you."" The first two are pretty straightforward, but pretty much everybody screws up the last one! Programmers have a lot of pride, and they think they can solve any problem, so they'll always say ""no blockers"". That's not actually helpful. Instead, each person should say what challenges they're facing, and give enough detail so that if any other team member knows something that can help, they can volunteer it.
Done right, the daily scrum should be over in 5 minutes; it's so fast that nobody should mind. And you must do it every day; otherwise it doesn't work.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day8-DALL%C2%B7E%202024-01-08--diverse-corporate-scrum-team.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Custom admin interface","Create a custom admin interface.
Drupal makes it really easy to create beautiful and functional interfaces. Site owners put tremendous time and effort into crafting their visitor's experiences, but almost everybody just points their own people at Drupal's default bare-bones content management display and leaves it at that. Why? It's really easy to create a few custom Views for your editors -- so you should.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day9-DALL%C2%B7E-2024-01-09-developers-renovating-kitchen.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Alphabetical group names","Let's do an easy one today. Modules display on the ""Extend"" in groups (called ""packages"") that are displayed in alphabetical order.  If your company's name starts with an ""A"" (or maybe even a ""B"") then go ahead and name your package that, but if it's not then pre-pend ""AA"" or even ""00"" to the group name, like this:
   name: Big Corp Custom Module X
   type: module
   package: 00 Big Corp
It's not a big thing, but if your company's branding department will let you get away with, then you can make the modules page easier to navigate.
(Honestly, this is compensating for a misfeature of Drupal -- this is an example of how the administrative interface inconveniently hides information that should we easier to find.)",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day10-DALL%C2%B7E-2024-01-10-panda-letters.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Use Docker","Use Docker!  Docker lets you create virtual computers, so that you can have miniature versions of your live site.  
You don't need to use Docker on its own, and probably shouldn't -- use of the environments that make it easier.  Any one of these three will do the trick -- choose whichever one feels right to you.
DDEV (https://ddev.com) seems to have the biggest following within the Drupal world these days; there's even a few folks pushing to adopt it as a standard.
Lando (https://lando.dev) is the one that I use (I'm friends with the founders) and the best choice if you like Star Wars references.
Docksal (https://docs.docksal.io) is also a terrific choice (I used it on a big government project I worked on last year.)
You'll need a fairly powerful machine (16GB or more of RAM and lots of disk space) and you should be comfortable with command-line Unix, but you'll soon understand why Docker is such a popular choice these days.  Since it's so easy to create multiple copies of whatever you're working on, you can afford to take chances and try things, which makes it a lot easier to work your way to a solution.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day11-DALL%C2%B7E-2024-01-11-robots-for-docker.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Watch the DriesNote","It's movie night! Twice a year, thousands of Drupalistas get together at DrupalCon. The best part of DrupalCon is the presentation given by @dries -- called the ""DriesNote"". It's always entertaining, as well as being informative. If you're not actually at DrupalCon, you should at least watch the DriesNote; it's broadcast for free as it's happening. In recent years, Dries seems to be talking more and more about making Drupal easier to use, and has specifically called out ""Site Builders"" as a role that should get more attention. This is music to my ears, since it's something that I've felt strongly about for a long time -- it's what's behind this whole ""Simplify Drupal"" thing, and 31 Days Of Simplifying Drupal. I'm happy that it's important to Dries, and I keep hoping it will pick up more steam in the Drupal community. This last October, at DrupalCon Europe in Lille, France, I thought he took it to another level. He presented the DriesNote as an illustrated fairy tale that he narrated. In it, he referenced other CMS systems in a way that was complimentary and, I thought, charming. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFxlDBLkLJc&t=215s",/sites/default/files/2024-05/31dosd-day12-driesnote-better.jpg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Bootswatch subthemes","Bootstrap's ""Bootswatch"" subthemes!  
Do you want to put together a ""decent"" looking site, but lack the budget (or perhaps just the patience) to hire a designer (for thousands of dollars) to get a custom theme?  Drupal might lack the well-designed free themes you can get with Wordpress (https://wordpress.org/themes/ #jealous) but you can at least get something usable (and some might say, even fun) if you install the popular Bootstrap theme (https://drupal.org/project/bootstrap) and figure out how to apply the Bootswatch themes (https://bootswatch.com.) 
They're actually usable out of the box, but they're a little hard to find -- if you didn't know they were there, you would never stumble on them.  To get them, first install Bootstrap and make it your default them, then go to the theme settings.  Now here's the weird part: the fourth (out of five) tab down, under ""CDN"" (of all things) is a pop-up menu that allows you to select any of the wonderful Bootswatch themes.
It's typical Drupal bang-your-head-against-the-wall frustrating that this wonderful capability is so thoroughly tucked away (even the project page barely mentions them) but once you find them, you can just select a theme and then stop worrying about it, until you get a budget for a designer.  (And if you do decide to customize, Bootstrap is a great place to start.)",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day13-bootswatches.jpg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Project Browser","Project Browser.
Drupal 8 introduced many changes to the way Drupal sites are constructed and managed.  One of the more confusing changes has been the use of Composer to install and manage modules and themes.  While Composer has some advantages, it has complicated this critical step, which needs to be accessible even to people trying Drupal for the first time.
During his keynote for the (online-only) DrupalCon 2021,
@dries
 talked about the need to show some more love for Site Builders, and introduced the Project Browser initiative:

"Always be migrating","No computer system lasts forever. But the data in the system is almost always more important than the code, and is often still relevant even after the system has reached the end of its expected lifespan. So...Don't wait! Do two things. First, when you load data into a website, keep a copy. Then as you build the site, and the data structures are fresh in mind (and you're building data displays) take just a little extra time and build in some data exports. They might come in handy someday. ",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day16-migrating.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"CSS Editor","17/31 days of making Drupal simpler and easier to manage: CSS Editor module. It's surprisingly difficult to make small visual changes in Drupal -- things like changing a font, setting a background color, putting a border around something. To make even small changes requires modifying a theme, or creating a new one, then getting it onto the server. While that might seem easy for a full-time themer on a development team, what options are there for the part-timer who just wants to make a little change? Fortunately, as the old Drupal saying goes, ""There's a module for that!"" CSS Editor (https://drupal.org/project/css_editor…) puts a ""Custom CSS"" field on the theme settings page, into which you can type CSS rules. Just fire up DevTools in your browser, figure out what rule you need to add to get the change you need, then paste it into the Custom CSS field. For quick and simple changes it will get the job done. #drupal #webdevelopment #31daysofsimplifyingdrupal",/sites/default/files/2024-01/day17-css-editor.png,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"

""Explain the format of the libraries file in a Drupal 10 module"" 
A subscription to ChatGPT 4 also gets you access to the amazing DALL-E image generator. I used DALL-E (the name is a mashup between ""WALL-E"" and surrealist painter Salvador Dali) to create the image below, as well as all the other images in this series that aren't screen grabs. 
The prompt that created this picture was: ""Create a picture of a robot teaching a class full of web developers about sql"" Isn't that amazing?
Here's the output of ""Explain the format of the libraries file in a Drupal 10 module:
In Drupal, the libraries file (typically named MODULENAME.libraries.yml) is used to define one or more libraries that a module (or theme) provides. Each library can contain CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, or other assets that the module or theme should include. This system allows Drupal to manage and optimize the loading of assets efficiently.
The libraries.yml file is a YAML file, which is a human-readable data serialization standard. In this file, you define each library with its unique name and specify the CSS, JS, dependencies, and other properties for the library.
Here's the general format of a libraries.yml file








library-name:
                                                                  version: VERSION

                                                                Explanation:


library-name: This is a unique identifier for the library within the module. You can define multiple libraries by adding more entries.


version: (Optional) Specifies the version of the library.


css: Defines CSS files to include. You can categorize them into different types like 'base', 'layout', 'component', 'state', or 'theme'. Each type can have different weights and priorities when the CSS is added to the page.

css/style.css: The path to the CSS file relative to the root of the module or theme.
{}: CSS options (like 'media' for media queries, 'preprocess' to enable or disable preprocessing, etc.).



js: Defines JavaScript files to include.

js/script.js: The path to the JS file relative to the root of the module or theme.
{}: JS options (like 'type' for the script type, 'minified' to indicate if the script is already minified, etc.).



dependencies: Lists the libraries that must be loaded before this library. It ensures that your library has all the necessary scripts or styles it depends on. Each dependency is specified in the format provider/library.


header: (Optional) A boolean (true/false) value indicating whether the JavaScript should be placed in the header. If omitted or set to false, JavaScript is placed at the bottom of the page by default (which is usually preferred for performance reasons).


Here's an example of how a module might define a library in its MODULENAME.libraries.yml file:
my_library:
                                                                  version: 1.x
                                                                  css:
                                                                    theme:
                                                                      css/my-styles.css: { media: all }
                                                                  js:
                                                                    js/my-scripts.js: {}
                                                                  dependencies:
                                                                    - core/jquery
                                                                    - core/drupal
                                                                In this example, my_library includes one CSS file, one JavaScript file, and has dependencies on jQuery and Drupal's core JavaScript.
When you want to attach this library to a render array in Drupal, you can use the following syntax:

php
$build['#attached']['library'][] = 'MODULENAME/my_library';

This system provides a structured way to manage assets in Drupal, ensuring that they are loaded in the correct order and only when needed.

"Don't put your best coder in charge of your site!","We understand: Drupal is made out of code, so it makes sense to put the master of code in charge of the site, managing all the other lesser coders. Don't do it! For one, it dumps a whole lot of non-coding responsibility on them, and you get a lot of value having them do what they do best. But perhaps more importantly, it puts responsibility for making sure the site works for everybody on the shoulders of somebody who doesn't really think like the rest of the people in the company. When they look at a site, they see the variables and functions and APIs and other components, but that's not what other people see! And one more thing: some day they will leave, and odds are pretty good the site will still be needed after they're gone -- you want to make sure they're not the only person who understands how everything fits together. You'll need to keep things running with whoever is left, so make sure there isn't anything that only one person understands.Also, you want to minimize the pieces in your site that can only be worked on by one person. Don't just throw them at the guru, find a way to make them less complicated and more accessible. (Maybe document them better?)Now to be clear, you do want whoever is in charge to be a top person -- somebody who understands the business, who know how to communicate with all the stakeholders, and who thoroughly understands the technology in your site. It's *possible* that person is also the top coder -- but it probably isn't.#drupal #webdevelopment #31daysofsimplifyingdrupal",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-23-mad-scientist.jpeg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Use Pantheon","Ok, this one might raise some eyebrows. I don't work for Pantheon, and they don't pay me. I've had many clients with sites on Pantheon, but also on Acquia Cloud Host, Platform.sh, AWS, Digital Ocean, and countless general-purpose hosting providers. Each of them have something (often quite a bit) to offer, but this series isn't about making Drupal better or cheaper or fancier -- it's about making Drupal simpler. And in that respect Pantheon stands head and shoulders above all the other options I've seen.While Pantheon provides many of the same services as many other high-performance hosts, it does so with an interface that helps a modern web developer get things done quickly, safely, and easily. Out of the box, it supports the Drupal best-practice ""three environment"" model: A production site, and development site, and a testing/staging environment that lets you test your latest code against your live database to eliminate (or at least drastically reduce) deployment surprises. It understands and supports Drupal's separation of code, database, and files. It fully supports git, but lets you use SFTP if you prefer. It fully supports all versions of Drupal, but also supports Backdrop and Wordpress. It has terrific easy-to-use backup facilities, and largely automates Drupal's sometimes aggravating upgrade process.The Pantheon environment makes things so much easier for me that I offer my clients a discount on my services if they host there. I don't get a kickback, it just makes my life that much easier.If you haven't used it, go over to https://pantheon.io/ and sign up for a free full-featured sandbox and check it out. No time limits, no hard sell -- a sandbox site gets you just about everything except the ability to launch your site with a custom domain name.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-24-pantheon.jpg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"You don't need superheroes","The job-listing sites are filled with ads looking for Drupal developers who have years of experience building Drupal sites, and are experts in object-oriented PHP programming, and are skilled with React and headless development, and are experts in SASS and Gulp and the rest of the front-end toolchain, and can create documentation for executives, and can design information architectures and user interfaces, and train the editorial staff, and optimize the SEO and e-commerce conversions, and...you get the idea.You don't need one person who can do everything. Design your workflow so that people can focus on the things they're best at, and spread the work around. Then, when there doesn't happen to be a superhero around, you can still keep things working as they're supposed to.

"Minimize the number of roles","It's tempting to create a role for each job title that is going to access the site. Don't do it! ""Role"" might sound like a synonym for ""job,"" but don't be fooled -- it's just a friendly term for a collection of privileges. Roles are convenient in small quantities, but they get to be a hassle when you get more than a handful. Here's a tip: if there are too many columns to fit on the ""Permissions"" screen without scrolling, you probably have too many roles. Choose your roles carefully, and try to limit their number.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-26-minimize-roles-edit-Medium.jpeg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Cowboy coding","It's commonly agreed that one should refrain from making changes on a ""live"" website, and instead use various techniques to make changes in some offline location and then push them to production. I do this for most of my own sites, and it's often required at large organizations. But it's not the only approach. I was recently surprised to discover that a number of web developers that I respect and admire maintain sites without an automated push technique. They'll figure out how to do something offline, then recreate it by hand on the live site.I wouldn't recommend it for most situations, but it's important to note that it's not impossible. It's better than NOT getting something down.I've even seen locked-down situations where people are editing on the live site anyway, because that's the only way to get something done. While you probably want to avoid having too much of this sort of thing, be aware that if you simply forbid it, it might happen anyway, so it's probably better to be aware and open about that. #drupal #webdevelopment #31daysofsimplifyingdrupal",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-27-cowbow-Medium.jpeg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Backdrop CMS","From its earliest days, major version upgrades of Drupal were difficult. New versions were incompatible with previous versions, requiring lots of work to upgrade from one version to the next. But the magnitude of the change from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 was much larger than any changes before or since. Backdrop CMS (https://backdropcms.org) is a ""fork"" of Drupal -- it started with Drupal's code as it existed in 2013, just before Drupal incorporated some very large structural changes. The biggest one of these was Drupal's decision to replace the very core of the project with Symfony, an independent PHP framework. While there are some important advantages to Symfony, it's requires an entirely different way of building modules. Drupal 8 also changed the way themes are constructed, so essentially every add-on component for every Drupal site needed to be rewritten. (And to further complicate matters, the decision was made to heavily promote the use of PHP's Composer package manager, instead installing Drupal and its components directly off the server as had been done previously.) Backdrop not only resisted this push towards greater complexity, it built a culture devoted to serving the needs of smaller development teams, who were being left behind by Drupal. It supports much older versions of PHP and MySQL, while also supporting the latest versions. It takes great pains to make sure that add-on modules and themes continue to work, even as it adds features. It very deliberately makes decisions that make things easier and more accessible for small developers, rather than favoring large enterprise teams. And it does all this while maintaining a deep commitment to security, coordinating responses to emerging threats in close cooperation with the Drupal security team. Finally, because it's built on the same architecture that Drupal 7 was, migrating from Drupal 7 to Backdrop is relatively straightforward and easy, compared to migrating to recent versions of Drupal. This is good news for the hundreds of thousands of sites that have so far found the migration to recent versions of Drupal too daunting. In many ways, Backdrop is a comprehensive approach to simplifying Drupal.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-28-backdropMedium.jpeg,"31daysofsimplifyingdrupal, BackdropCMS, Drupal Planet"
"Use sql","At its surface, Drupal seems to be a lot of CSS and Javascript being pushed around by lots and lots of PHP code -- these days with healthy chunks of Composer, Twig, and some other things.  Inside, though, at its core, is a SQL database.  (Usually -- but if your Drupal site isn't running SQL, you're probably not actually interested in simplifying Drupal.)Taking a peek at the database tables inside of a Drupal site and you'll often see a simpler structure than you see on the outside.  Nodes, fields, taxonomy relationships -- it's amazing what you can learn with a few simple select statements.  (Want help writing them?  Ask ChatGPT, its happy to help.)Have fun spelunking!",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-29-sql-x-ray-medium.jpeg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
"Wireframes are better than comps","Everyone knows what a wireframe is -- the name practically describes it, it's a sketch that looks like it's made out of wires. Or, more likely, drawn with a pen on a napkin. You probably think it's done with simple boxes and lines because that's easier, right? So when you have a meeting to look at wireframes, and you see some beautiful comps made in photoshop that look just like web pages, with colors and textures and photos and everything, you should be happy -- that's better! Right? Isn't it?It's not. Send it back, and demand the sketches.Wireframes are not low-fidelity comps, any more than Starry Night is a blurry picture of a nighttime sky. What's important about a wireframe is not what's left out, it's what's left in -- the key ingredients, the elements that matter. A good wireframe distills the essence of a design into the fewest number of elements possible. If done right, you shouldn't actually need comps -- from the wireframe you can go straight to code. Don't like something? It's easier to change a few lines of CSS than it is to redo a layered Photoshop file, and more representational too. Websites are dynamic things, and the extra detail you get in a comp is just an illusion anyway -- the quicker you get to some sort of prototype, the quicker you'll be able to confidently make the decisions you need to make.Less is more. ",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-30-wireframes-medium.jpeg,"webdesign, uxdesign, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal, Drupal Planet"
"Don't give your programmers access to your site!","Ok, this one is going to be controversial, but hear me out. There's a lot of complicated programming contained within any Drupal site, but unless you've done something wrong it all plugs into Drupal's administrative interface, which can be operated by any reasonably tech-literate person. There is no reason the people who operate the administrative interface need to be experts in the arcane details of Drupal programming. While you need programmers to write the modules and themes, you don't need them to install the components for you -- you can, and should, take care of that yourself.Of course, the programmers need to have copies of the site, in order to be able to write the modules, themes, libraries, patches, and other assorted bits of code that are needed to create a fully-finished site. Of course they'll need copies of the code and (appropriately sanitized) database. They might even need to have access to an online dev environment to develop and test integrations. But unless you have a very unusual situation, they do not actually need access to the production environment. Don't just deploy a zillion Git commits, where nobody except for the programmer has any idea what's going on. If they're writing modules, have them give you the modules -- via email, if necessary.It's a HUGE advantage to have somebody install the modules and themes other than the person who wrote them. It ensures that the installation procedure is clear, well-understood, and documented. It encourages transparency among the team, so that everybody understands what everybody else is doing. And it increases the number of eyes on each step, without actually slowing things down and making it harder.Take control of your site.",/sites/default/files/2024-01/31dosd-day-31-diverse-programmers-out-medium.jpeg,"Drupal Planet, 31daysofsimplifyingdrupal"
